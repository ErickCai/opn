PyMeta
------

PyMeta is a framework for experimenting on metaheuristic optimization algorithms.

This software is in alpha stage. They are useful for us, but we do not accept
any kind of responsibility if you use it. They may ruin your day or more... You are 
warned. 

We have been using this software on Python 2.7.x and 64 bit Windows 7. numpy, 
mayavi, and matplotlib are dependencies.

For installation, currently you need to download the zip, extract the files, 
and add 'PyMeta' directory to your pythonpath. 

See examples in the PyMeta/bin directory for the usage.

The repo management will folow the approach explained here:
