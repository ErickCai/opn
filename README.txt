Welcome to the opn Repository
----------------------------------------
This is a repository of projects related to (heuristic) global optimization:

    - CEC14py is a project for wrapping CEC 2014 Single Objective Optimization 
    competition c files.

    - PyMeta is a project for building a framework for experimenting 
    metaheuristic optimization algorithms. It is geared towards scientific 
    experimentation and algorithm clarity. PyMeta uses CEC14py.

Licence is GPL.

These software are in alpha stage. They are useful for us, but we do not accept
any kind of responsibility for it. They may ruin your day or more... You are 
warned. 

We have been using the software on Python 2.7.x, 64 bit Windows 7. numpy, 
mayavi, matplotlib, statsmodels are some library they depend.

There is a qite bit number of todos in TODO.py, and other '#TODO:'s in the 
code. You are free to submit pull requests. 

We should use the git-flow repository management approach explained here:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

For installation, currently you need to download the zip, extract the files, 
and add 'PyMeta' and 'CEC14Py/cec14py' directories to your pythonpath. 

See examples in the PyMeta/bin directory for the usage.
