opn/opn
========
opn/opn is a set of algorithms, problems, and visualisers to help in scientific experimentation on global optimization, especially metaheuristic optimization.


License & Warning
=================
You may use this software freely in your academic work. For commercial use, contact developers.

This software is in alpha stage. They are useful for us, but we do not accept any kind of responsibility if you use them. They may ruin your day or more... You are warned. 


Repository
==========
The code is in https://bitbucket.org/oaltun/opn

The repository management will follow the approach explained in 
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Installation & Dependencies
===========================
For installation, currently you need to download the zip, extract the files, and add 'opn' directory to your pythonpath. 

We have been using this software on Python 2.7.x and 64 bit Windows 7. 

You need to install following Python libraries before using opn/opn: pyqt4, numpy, mayavi, and matplotlib.

Documentation
=============
As this code was written to support our `academic`_ work, most of the current documentation is automatically generated by Sphinx. Algorithm clarity has been one of our goals from the start however, so the code should be easy to follow. The code is linked in all auto-generated documentation.

The :doc:`API <opn>` page has the automatically generated documentation.

opn/bin directory includes an example script: :doc:`sample script <simple>`.
